# Problem Description

You have the perfect roommate. He cooks everyday. However what he cooks everyday changes based on a few conditions:


1. He cooks 3 things: Pie, Burger, or Chicken
2. He cooks these items in a sequence: P -> B -> C -> P -> B -> C ...
3. If the weather is nice, then he goes out and eats the leftovers, so he does not make anything new. ie: if sunny, then if yesterday he ate pie, he eats pie again today. If it rains, then he makes burgers

Create a model that predicts what he will make if given what he made yesterday and the next day's weather
