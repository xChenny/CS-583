** Basic Vector and Matrix Operations

*** Multiplication

   - Vector-Vector multiplication
   - Vector-Matrix multiplication
   - Matrix-Matrix multiplication
   - Matrix-Vector multiplication
   
*** Finding Matrix Inverse

    - For 2x2 Matrix:

      If A =

        \[\begin{bmatrix}
        a&b\\
        c&d\\
        \end{bmatrix}\]

      A^{-1} =

        1/det(A) *
    \[\begin{bmatrix}
        d&-b\\
        -c&a\\
        \end{bmatrix}\]

     - For 3x3 Matrix:
     - Write a picture for this

    
*** Determinant

    The factor by which a linear transformation changes the "area/volume" of a unit square/cube in a grid

    If negative, then the unit square is "flipped" over its axis. (Like a square on paper after flipping the piece of paper)

    - If A =

     \[\begin{bmatrix}
     a&b\\
     c&d\\
     \end{bmatrix}\]


     **det(A) = ad - bc**

     - For calculating 3x3 matrices, go along the top row, and for a, b, c, cover the current row and column of a, b, c and multiply the a, b, c with the determinant of the uncovered numbers.
       - For the "a" term, it's positive
       - For the "b" term, it's negative
       - For the "c" term, it's positive

     - If M =
     
      \[\begin{bmatrix}
      a&b&c\\
      d&e&f\\
      g&h&i\\
      \end{bmatrix}\]

      A = 
      \[\begin{bmatrix}
      e&f\\
      h&i\\
      \end{bmatrix}\]

      B = 
      \[\begin{bmatrix}
      d&f\\
      g&i\\
      \end{bmatrix}\]

      C = 
      \[\begin{bmatrix}
      d&e\\
      g&h\\
      \end{bmatrix}\]

      **det(M) = a*det(A) - b*det(B) + c*det(C)**

*** Condition Number

    This is a measure of how much a small change in the transformation matrix or the output would affect the input vector

    [[./images/condition1.png]]
    #+CAPTION: If a small change in the A, or output occurs, how much is v affected?

    - If condition(A) \cong 1.0 \rightarrow "Well Conditioned"
    - If condition(A) > 1.0 \rightarrow "Ill Conditioned"
    - Condition(A): \kappa(A) = ||A|| * ||A^{-1}||

** Vector Norms

   - l_{\infty} Norm:

      max_{i}|x_{i}|

   - l_{p} Norm:

     \Sigma_{i=1}^{n} (|n|^{p})^{1/p}

** Vector Derivatives

   - General Derivatives

** Machine Learning Basics

   1. Regression
   2. Classification
   3. Clustering
   4. Dimensionality Reduction
   5. Activations functions (Logistic, ReLU, Leaky ReLU...)
   6. Convex functions
