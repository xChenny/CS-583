* SVM
  

* Softmax

  - Meant to solve multi-class classification problems (face recognition, handwriting->alphanumeric chars)
  - Cross entropy loss function is most popular pairing
    - Cross entropy is a measure of how "similar" two distributions are.
    - Maximum cross entropy -> the two distributions are more similar

* Optimization

  - Convex: When you make a line segment between any two points in a domain, all point along the line segment must still be within the domain
